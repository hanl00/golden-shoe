# Golden shoe
This is a mock ecommerce shop for Golden Shoe

## Backend - Django rest framework
* created product api for list of products
* testing

## Frontend - React with redux
* tackled most of the issues faced by Golden Shoe from the handout
* make request to backend (only fetching products so far)
* testing

## Lauching the app
* Backend - check Readme.md
* Frontend - `npm install`, followed by `npm start`

## Future work:
* more backend support (discount codes, delivery status)
* more testing, especially on backend
* transition to use backend data instead of mock data from src/static/data.js
